## PERSUASION FRAMEWORK: 48 LAWS APPLIED TO TILE

- **Law 1: Never Outshine the Master**  
    *Empower clients with knowledge*  
    _“You deserve to know why TCNA standards matter for your project.”_

- **Law 4: Always Say Less Than Necessary**  
    *Imply depth, avoid jargon overload*  
    _“TCNA 2024 update: 95% thinset coverage for large-format tile. Most skip this.”_

- **Law 6: Court Attention at All Cost**  
    *Bold, memorable headlines*  
    _“Tile Work That Outlasts the Mortgage—Documented, Tested, Proven.”_

- **Law 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect**  
    *Signal selectivity, not scarcity theater*  
    _“Booked 4–8 weeks out. Not every project is a fit.”_

- **Law 27: Create a Cult Following**  
    *Position standards as the only way*  
    _“TCNA-compliant installations vs. ‘some guy who watches YouTube’.”_

- **Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness**  
    *Definitive, technical claims*  
    _“Cracked tile? It’s deflection or wrong thinset. Always.”_

- **Law 30: Make Accomplishments Seem Effortless**  
    *Mastery through casual expertise*  
    _“Substrate flatness (1/8\" in 10')—basic, but most never check.”_

- **Law 33: Discover Each Man’s Thumbscrew**  
    *Address real contractor pain points*  
    _“Texts returned same-day. Not ‘left on read’ for three weeks.”_

- **Law 37: Create Compelling Spectacles**  
    *Visual proof, documented process*  
    _“Flood test photos for your records—no ‘trust me, it’s waterproof’.”_

- **Law 43: Work on Hearts and Minds**  
    *Values alignment, not just specs*  
    _“Built for long-term performance, not short-term profit.”_

## TONE VARIATIONS BY CONTEXT

- **Homepage/Hero**: Bold, technical, provocative  
    _“The Tile Work That Outlasts the Mortgage”_

- **Service Descriptions**: Specific, standards-driven, contrast shortcuts  
    _“C2-rated thinset, not ‘whatever’s at the truck’”_

- **About/Process**: Personality, transparency, humor  
    _“We’re the kind of annoying that measures substrate flatness”_

- **Technical Content**: Authoritative, plain language, cite standards  
    _“ANSI A108.10 waterproofing—because ‘probably fine’ isn’t a plan”_

---

## LANGUAGE PATTERNS

- **Power Words**: Documented, Tested, Standards-Compliant, Licensed (#13VH10808800), Verified, Accountable, Realistic, Preventive
- **Humor**: Self-deprecating pedantry, absurdist comparisons, exaggerated obviousness, sarcastic air quotes, parenthetical asides
- **Technical Specificity**: Always pair terms with implications  
    _“L/360 deflection (so your tile doesn’t crack)”_
- **Contrast**:  
    _“Schluter KERDI membrane, not red paint from the box store”_  
    _“Texts returned same-day, not left on read”_

---

## SENTENCE STRUCTURE

- **Headlines**: Bold, technical, or provocative  
    _“Built to Last. Installed with Judgment.”_
- **Body Copy**: Short punch, technical detail, payoff/humor  
    _“Your floor isn’t flat. We measure deflection (L/360), check substrate (1/8\" in 10'), and find moisture issues before they’re surprises.”_
- **Bullets**:  
    _**Waterproof showers that don’t leak**: Schluter KERDI, flood tested, seam details correct. Because ‘probably fine’ isn’t waterproofing._

---

## POSITIONING: THE ANTI-CORNER-CUTTER

- **What We Are**:  
    Standards-compliant (TCNA, ANSI, OSHA), documentation-obsessed, communication-focused, owner-operated, selective
- **Contrast Without Naming**:  
    _“We measure substrate flatness (most don’t).”_  
    _“Ask your quote for their HIC number. We’ll wait.”_  
    _“C2-rated thinset with ISO 13007 certification (not ‘whatever’s on sale’).”_

---

## CONTENT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

- **Service Pages**:  
    Bold claim → Technical specifics → Contrast → Client benefit
- **About/Process**:  
    Personality → Technical competence → Process clarity → CTA
- **Blog Posts**:  
    Common question → Technical answer → Practical implication → DIY vs. pro
- **Social Media**:  
    Progress photos, technical captions, before/after, “things we find”

---

## RED LINES (NEVER CROSS)

- **Don’t**:  
    Name competitors, use fear-mongering, overpromise, disparage DIY, use unexplained jargon, be negative without solutions, compromise safety, mock homeowners
- **Do**:  
    Contrast methods, address concerns with solutions, set realistic expectations, offer to assess/repair DIY, explain terms, point out problems *and* solutions, take safety seriously, educate for informed decisions

---

## REGIONAL VOICE (NJ/South Jersey)

- **References**: Shore houses, nor’easter flooding, humidity, old housing, coastal salt air (sparingly)
- **Tone**: Direct, friendly, self-effacing, proud of local workmanship, practical about coastal challenges

---

## CLIENT AVATARS

- **Primary: Burned Homeowners**  
    _“Texts returned same-day. No ‘I’ll call you back’ that never happens.”_
- **Secondary: Detail-Oriented Homeowners**  
    _“TCNA standards, ANSI waterproofing, documented at every step.”_
- **Tertiary: Landlords/Property Managers**  
    _“Built for long-term durability with photo logs for your property files.”_
- **Quaternary: General Contractors**  
    _“Scope docs, progress updates, coordination that makes you look good.”_

---

## VOICE EXAMPLES

- **Before (Generic)**  
    _“We provide quality tile installation services with attention to detail and customer satisfaction.”_
- **After (Tillerstead Voice)**  
    _“We install tile the annoying way: substrate flatness verified, thinset coverage at 95%, and flood testing before a single tile goes in. Slower than ‘some guy.’ More expensive than the Craigslist quote. But you only pay once.”_
