# GitHub Pages Deployment – Tillerstead.com

Tillerstead’s site is deployed via GitHub Actions using the `.github/workflows/pages.yml` workflow, which leverages `actions/deploy-pages@v4` for secure, standards-compliant publishing. To ensure successful deployment and maintain TCNA 2024 and NJ HIC compliance:

1. **Repository Settings:**  
    - Navigate to **Settings → Pages**.
    - Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
    - Confirm the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `pages: write` permission.

2. **Workflow Behavior:**  
    - If Pages is disabled or the source is not set to GitHub Actions, the `Deploy to GitHub Pages` job will fail with a "workflow is not authorized to deploy to GitHub Pages" error.
    - This failure is immediate and indicates a misconfiguration, not a build or code error.

3. **Remediation:**  
    - Enable GitHub Pages as described above.
    - Rerun the workflow to allow the `deploy` job to publish the `github-pages` artifact generated by the `build` job.

4. **Compliance & Best Practices:**  
    - All deployment artifacts are validated for accessibility, performance, and legal compliance per NJ Consumer Fraud Act and TCNA guidelines.
    - Site structure, asset naming, and workflow keys follow OUTPUT_RULES.md for clarity and maintainability.

For further details or troubleshooting, consult the centralized `.ai/` instruction set, especially `SYSTEM.md` and `OUTPUT_RULES.md`, to ensure all deployment actions meet Tillerstead’s technical and legal standards.
