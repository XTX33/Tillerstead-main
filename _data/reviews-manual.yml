    quote_html: <p>It was a pleasure working with Devon to repair our ceiling in our closet. We chose to repair it rather than replace. Devon walked us through what that would look like offering the most cost effective option. He was very professional. I recommend working with him!!</p>

      <p>I recently hired Devon for a bathroom remodel, and my wife and I couldn’t be happier with the results. From start to finish, Devon was professional, punctual, and detail-oriented. He took the time to listen to what we wanted, offered helpful suggestions, and executed everything with precision.</p>
      <p>Devon kept the work area tidy throughout the project and completed the job on time without cutting corners.</p>
      <p>It’s rare to find someone who truly takes pride in their work the way Devon does. I’d highly recommend him.</p>

#     <p>Devon did an exceptional job on our master bathroom renovation. 
#     The attention to detail was impressive—every tile perfectly aligned, 
#     and the waterproofing was thoroughly documented.</p>
#     <p>He explained every step of the process and why certain methods 
#     were necessary. The shower hasn't had a single issue after 6 months 
#     of daily use.</p>
