**Last updated:** December 2025

## 1. Licensed & Insured New Jersey Contractor

Tillerstead LLC (“we,” “our,” “us”) is a New Jersey–licensed and insured Home Improvement Contractor (NJ HIC License #{{ site.company.hic }}).

## 2. Estimates, Proposals & Written Agreements

- Formal proposals specify scope, materials, start dates, pricing, and payment schedules per N.J.A.C. 13:45A-16.2.
- No work begins until written acceptance (including email) and deposit are received.
- Proposals remain valid for 30 days unless otherwise stated.

### Right to Cancel (Three-Day Rule)

## 6. Change Orders (N.J.A.C. 13:45A-16.2 Requirement)

Any change to scope, materials, pricing, or timeline requires a written, mutually signed change order. This ensures transparency and protects both client and contractor from misunderstandings.

## 7. Workmanship & Materials Standards

- Permit responsibility is defined in the agreement; Tillerstead can obtain permits as required.
- Discovery of hidden defects (e.g., rot, mold, structural issues, prior improper work) may require additional repairs not included in the initial estimate.

## 9. Warranties

- Tillerstead LLC warrants its workmanship per written agreement; warranty applies only to labor performed by Tillerstead.
- Product warranties are provided by manufacturers and governed by their terms.
- Damage from misuse, neglect, third-party alterations, or pre-existing conditions is excluded.
