## About Tillerstead LLC

Tillerstead LLC is a New Jersey-licensed home improvement contractor (NJ HIC #13VH12345600) specializing in tile, bath, and remodeling. Our work is governed by TCNA 2024 standards and full NJ HIC compliance, ensuring technical precision, transparency, and lasting value—contrasting sharply with industry shortcuts.

- **Compliance:** All site content, contracts, and communications adhere to the NJ Consumer Fraud Act and accessibility best practices (see [`_data/compliance.yml`](./_data/compliance.yml)).
- **Transparency:** Every process is documented for client clarity and regulatory audit.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS), ES6+ JavaScript
- **Site Generator:** Custom Jekyll (vendored in `vendor/gems/jekyll`)
- **Package Manager:** npm (dev dependencies only)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages / Netlify
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

---

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm ci
   ```
2. **Build CSS:**
   ```sh
   npm run build:css
   ```
3. **Build the site:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Start local server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) to preview.

## Ruby Environment (Windows)

- Install [RubyInstaller 3.1+ with MSYS2](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/). Select option 3 to run `ridk install` for DevKit and build tools.
- From PowerShell in the project root:
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/activate-ruby.ps1
  ```
  This ensures the Ruby toolchain is on `PATH` for the vendored Jekyll executable.
- If Ruby is in a non-standard directory:
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/activate-ruby.ps1 -RubyRoot 'D:\Tools\Ruby32-x64'
  ```
- Re-run the activation script in every new PowerShell session.

## Local & Codespaces Development

- **Codespaces:** Auto-builds a dev container with Ruby 3.2 and Node 20. Dependencies install via `npm ci`.
- **Local:** Install Ruby 3.2 and Node 20, then run `npm ci`.
- **Dev server:** `npm run dev` compiles assets, builds `_site`, and serves at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.
- **Build:** `npm run build` compiles CSS and runs the vendored Jekyll build.
- **Test:** `npm run test` rebuilds and checks internal links/assets for compliance and accessibility.

---

## Authoring & Workflow

- **Design tokens:** Edit `_sass/base/_tokens.scss`
- **Component styles:** Edit `_sass/components/_theme.scss`
- **Content:** Add/edit Markdown in `_posts/` (dated) or `pages/` (evergreen). Use `_data/` YAML/JSON for repeatable blocks.
- **Templates:** Modify `_layouts/` (wrappers) and `_includes/` (partials).
- **Images:** Use `npm run images:webp` to generate WebP variants in `assets/`. All images must have descriptive, standards-compliant alt text (see OUTPUT_RULES.md).

---

## Quality, Linting & Compliance

- **Lint all:** `npm run lint` (JS, HTML, SCSS, front-end conventions)
- **SCSS:** `npm run lint:css` (validate), `npm run lint:css:fix` (auto-fix)
- **Format:** `npm run format` (Prettier)
- **Accessibility:** All content and code must pass accessibility checks (see COMPLIANCE.md).
- **Build:** CSS is compressed for performance; all output is validated for SEO and legal compliance.

---

## SEO & Accessibility

- **Metadata:** Defaults in `_config.yml`—keep titles, descriptions, and keywords specific to South Jersey property services.
- **Semantic HTML:** Required in all layouts/includes for accessibility (see STYLE.md).
- **Alt text:** All images require descriptive, context-specific alt text (see _data/compliance.yml).
- **WebP:** Use WebP for optimal performance.

---

## Production & Automation

- **Build for deploy:**
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```
  Output appears in `_site/` for static hosting (Netlify config in `netlify.toml`).
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint/test on every push/PR and uploads `_site` as an artifact.
- **Pages/Previews:** `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds for production and publishes preview deployments for PRs.
