  <h2 id="terms-heading">Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 2024</p>

  <h2>1. General Terms</h2>
  <p>
    All website content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a binding offer, estimate, or legal agreement. Binding terms, pricing, and schedules are established exclusively through a written proposal or contract, signed by both Tillerstead LLC and the client, in accordance with the New Jersey Home Improvement Contractor (NJ HIC) Act and TCNA standards (<a href="https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/hic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NJ HIC Law</a>).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Services &amp; Estimates</h2>
  <p>
    Verbal, phone, email, or web-based estimates are non-binding until confirmed in a signed, written proposal that details scope, materials, and pricing. All work is performed strictly as described in the final, NJ HIC-compliant contract. Changes to scope require a written change order, subject to adjusted pricing and scheduling. Tillerstead LLC reserves the right to revise or withdraw estimates if project details, site conditions, or material availability change.
