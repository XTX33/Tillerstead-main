      <h2 id="financing-main-heading">TCNA-Compliant Financing for Tile &amp; Bath Work</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Proper prep, waterproofing, and layout are non-negotiable for lasting results. If your budget is tight, we’ll phase the project or connect you with reputable financing—never at the expense of code compliance or best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tillerstead never marks up rates or uses “teaser” pricing. Every estimate is written, detailed, and NJ HIC-compliant. You decide: pay in full, phase the work, or apply for third-party financing.
      </p>

      <h2>How Financing Works</h2>
      <ol class="financing-steps">
        <li><strong>Scope the project:</strong> We inspect your space, discuss goals, and outline phases as needed—always referencing TCNA and manufacturer specs.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent pricing:</strong> You receive a written, line-item estimate covering labor, materials, and all options—no hidden fees.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose your payment method:</strong> Pay in full, phase the work, or apply for financing through Acorn Finance’s secure platform.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="microcopy">
        Financing is always optional. We never compromise on waterproofing, substrate prep, or code compliance to “fit” a rushed budget.
