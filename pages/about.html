      Tillerstead LLC is what happens when a contractor actually follows TCNA standards and NJ HIC regulations. 
      We deliver waterproof showers that pass flood tests, provide photo documentation for every phase, and ensure your project meets code—protecting you from costly remediation and insurance headaches.

      <h2 id="experience-heading">Why Details Matter: TCNA & ANSI Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        Tyler measures substrate flatness with both a 10' straightedge and a digital level, per TCNA EJ171. 
        He distinguishes between modified and unmodified thinset (ANSI A118.1 vs. A118.4) and explains why waterproofing is more than “some red paint.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach takes more time and costs more than “some guy”—but it means your shower passes flood tests, your tile doesn’t crack, and you avoid mold remediation. 
        We document every step, from substrate prep to membrane flood testing, so you know exactly what’s behind your tile.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work in occupied homes (with daily HEPA vacuuming and dust barriers), rental properties (where timelines matter), and with GCs who value contractors that show up, communicate, and document everything.

        <li><strong>Daily photo documentation:</strong> Substrate prep, waterproofing, flood test results, and tile setting—archived for your records and insurance.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive communication:</strong> Calls and texts returned same day. No “maybe next week” replies.</li>
        <li><strong>Accurate timelines:</strong> If we say two weeks, it’s two weeks. No bait-and-switch scheduling.</li>

        <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If your contractor’s quote doesn’t list an HIC number, they’re unlicensed or hoping you won’t ask. Always verify NJ HIC status at <a href="https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/hic/Pages/default.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NJ Consumer Affairs</a>.
