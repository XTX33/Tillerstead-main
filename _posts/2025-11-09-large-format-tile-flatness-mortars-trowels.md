title: "Large-Format Tile Done Right: Flatness, Mortars, & Trowels"
description: "Installing large-format tile in South Jersey? Here’s how Tillerstead ensures flat substrates, the right mortar choice, and consistent coverage for floors and walls that stay beautiful."

Large-format tile—**15″ or greater on any side**—delivers a seamless, modern aesthetic. But performance and longevity depend on strict adherence to **TCNA** and **ANSI** standards. At **Tillerstead LLC**, we don’t cut corners: every step is engineered for lasting results and NJ HIC compliance.

## ⚖️ Flatness: The Foundation of Success

Tile only performs as well as the surface beneath it.  
**TCNA Handbook (Methods TR115 & TR117)** mandates:

- **≤1/8″ variation in 10 ft** (≤1/16″ in 24″) for tiles **<15″**
- **≤1/8″ in 10 ft** for tiles **≥15″**
- Flatness verified with a 10 ft straightedge per TCNA tolerance

**Our process:**  
We **mechanically grind or float** high/low spots, using self-leveling underlayments or patching compounds as needed. This eliminates lippage and hollow spots—common failures with large-format tile.

> **Pro Tip:** The larger the tile, the tighter the flatness tolerance. Substrate prep is non-negotiable.

## 🧱 Mortar Selection: Bond Strength That Lasts

Large-format and gauged porcelain panels require **improved bond strength** and **non-sag performance**.  
We specify mortars that meet or exceed:

- **ANSI A118.4** — Modified thin-set mortars
- **ANSI A118.15** — High-performance mortars for demanding applications

**Preferred mortars:**  
- *LATICRETE® 4-XLT*, *MAPEI® Ultraflex LFT*, *Custom® ProLite®*
- **Extended open time** for precise layout
- **Non-sag/medium-bed** properties to support heavy tiles

**Why it matters:**  
Standard thinset (A118.1) can slump, causing uneven bond lines and voids. We use only mortars proven for large-format installations.

## 🔧 Trowel & Coverage: No Voids, No Excuses

Coverage is critical:  
**TCNA & ANSI A108.5 require:**

- **≥80% coverage** (dry areas)
- **≥95% coverage** (wet areas: showers, floors)
- No voids >2 in²; none within 2″ of tile edges

**Our method:**
1. Select trowel size to match tile back (typically 1/2"×1/2" or Euro-notch)
2. Apply mortar with **parallel ridges** (one direction)
3. **Back-butter** all large tiles to fill depressions
4. **Lift and check** initial tiles for full coverage and ridge collapse

> Proper ridge orientation and a 45° trowel angle allow air to escape, ensuring continuous contact and eliminating weak spots.
