If you’ve never hired a licensed home improvement contractor in New Jersey, your first consultation can feel opaque. **Tillerstead LLC** makes it straightforward: a calm walkthrough, clear expectations, and a proposal based on your real space—not guesswork or “ballpark” numbers.

This guide shows you how to prep in **15 minutes** for a consultation (Atlantic County and all South Jersey) that’s efficient, accurate, and fully NJ HIC/TCNA compliant.

## What We Assess—and Why It Matters

During a tile or bathroom consultation, we don’t “eyeball it.” We evaluate the factors that determine project longevity and code compliance:

- **Moisture management**  
   We trace water flow—splash zones, corners, and any leak history—to plan for **true waterproofing** (ANSI A118.10/TCNA B422), not just “water-resistant” claims.

- **Substrate & flatness**  
   Tile mirrors its substrate. Large-format tile demands flat, stable planes (TCNA EJ171, ANSI A108.02). We check subfloor, backer board, and any humps or dips to prevent lippage and hollow spots.

- **Structure & transitions**  
   We assess floor deflection (L/360 minimum per TCNA F250), thresholds, and how tile meets carpet, LVP, or hardwood—eliminating trip hazards and ensuring smooth transitions.

- **Ventilation**  
   Properly ducted fans (per IRC M1507) protect grout, paint, and framing from South Jersey humidity. We verify fan type, duct runs, and vent terminations.

- **Lifestyle fit**  
   Your cleaning habits, color preferences, and tolerance for grout lines inform our recommendations. A busy family bath gets different specs than a guest suite.

## Five Photos to Take Before Your Consultation

Clear photos enable a realistic, code-based estimate—no phone tag, no surprises. Please provide:

1. **Full room overview**  
    Stand in the doorway; capture floor, walls, and ceiling in one shot.

2. **Wet area close-ups**  
    Show the shower or tub surround, including corners, valve wall, and any visible issues.

3. **Threshold and floor at entry**  
    Document transitions—step into the bath, adjoining flooring, and height differences.

4. **Problem areas**  
    Cracked grout, loose tiles, soft spots, or stains—anything concerning.

5. **Exhaust fan and ducting**  
    Photo of the fan and, if accessible, the duct or vent termination (attic/exterior).

> **Pro tip:** Also snap **shutoff valves**, **trap/drain**, and any **access panel**. These details help us plan demo and tie-ins, minimizing surprises and delays.

## Quick Measurements to Have Ready

Precision isn’t required—just enough for scale and material planning:

- Room **length × width**
- **Ceiling height**
- **Wet area length × width** (shower/tub surround)
- Planned **tile size** (e.g., 12×24, 24×48, mosaic)
- Any **niche, bench, or ledge** ideas
- Preference for **linear drain** or **center drain**

These basics let us discuss layouts, waste factor, and whether leveling or framing corrections are needed.
