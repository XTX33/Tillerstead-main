You can source robust, code-compliant shower waterproofing at **Home Depot**—if you know what to look for and how to install it. The difference between a lasting shower and a future leak isn’t the brand; it’s **TCNA-compliant prep, manufacturer-correct methods, and NJ HIC-licensed execution**. That’s the Tillerstead standard for Atlantic County and South Jersey.

Below, we break down the **Good–Better–Best** options, with technical specifics and pro-level cautions.

## 🟢 Good: Liquid-Applied Waterproofing (e.g., RedGard®)

**Best for:** Standard layouts, budget-conscious projects, or repairs over cement board.

**How it works:** A liquid membrane (like RedGard®) is rolled or troweled directly onto cement board, forming a seamless waterproof barrier.

**Critical details:**

- Apply to **manufacturer-specified thickness** (use a **wet-film gauge**—ANSI A118.10).
- Ensure **full coverage** at all corners, seams, and penetrations.
- Allow for **complete curing** before tiling—don’t shortcut dry times.

**Advantages:**  
✅ Widely available at Home Depot  
✅ Flexible for irregular layouts  
✅ Cost-effective and fast to apply  

**Risks:**  
⚠️ Most failures result from thin coats or missed corners—inspect with a wet-film gauge.  
⚠️ Rushing cure time leads to adhesion and waterproofing failures.

## 🟡 Better: Sheet Membrane Systems (e.g., Schluter® KERDI)

**Best for:** Full shower rebuilds where you want verifiable, surface-level waterproofing.

**How it works:** Sheets (like KERDI) are embedded in thinset, overlapped, and sealed with banding and pre-formed corners, creating a continuous waterproof layer.

**Advantages:**  
✅ Waterproofing is right at the surface—no wicking into backer  
✅ Easy to **flood test** per code before tiling  
✅ Proven in both DIY and pro installs  

**Risks:**  
⚠️ Overlap seams per manufacturer spec (typically 2" minimum—see TCNA B422).  
⚠️ Use **unmodified thinset** for Schluter systems—incorrect mortar voids warranty.  
⚠️ Plan corners and penetrations in advance; improper folds = leaks.

---

## 🟣 Best: Foam Backer Boards + Integrated Pans (e.g., KERDI-BOARD®, KERDI-SHOWER, GoBoard®)

**Best for:** Full rebuilds, large-format tile, or projects needing precision, flatness, and integrated drains.

**How it works:** Lightweight foam boards and prefabricated pans form a waterproof substrate, tying into manufacturer drain kits for a single, testable assembly.

**Advantages:**  
✅ Ultra-flat, stable planes for **large-format tile**  
✅ Minimal exposed fasteners in wet zones when detailed per manufacturer  
✅ Faster, cleaner, and lighter than cement board  

**Risks:**  
⚠️ Use only **manufacturer-approved fasteners, washers, tapes, sealants, and drains**—mixing brands voids warranties and code compliance.  
⚠️ Follow all screw spacing, bedding, and slope requirements; seal every penetration.

## 💡 The Pro Angle: Method > Brand

All three systems—liquid, sheet, foam—can pass a flood test and last decades **if installed to TCNA and manufacturer standards**. The weak link is always the method, not the product.

At **Tillerstead**, we:

- Install to **ANSI A118.10/A118.12** and **TCNA** details (B422, B421, EJ171).
- Use **movement joints** per TCNA EJ171 for crack isolation.
- Perform and document **flood tests** before tile.
- Provide photo documentation of prep and waterproofing for every project (NJ HIC compliance).

**You can buy the materials—Tillerstead ensures they’re assembled to code, not just “stuck together.”**

**Bottom line:**  
Big-box stores sell quality waterproofing, but only code-compliant detailing, sealing, and documentation deliver lasting results—and protect your investment.

If you’re in **South Jersey or Atlantic County**, let’s plan the right mix of DIY and professional installation for your project.

**Next step:**
