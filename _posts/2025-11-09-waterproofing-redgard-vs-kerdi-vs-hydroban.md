title: "Waterproofing 101: RedGard® vs Schluter® KERDI vs LATICRETE® HYDRO BAN®"
description: "A technical, code-compliant comparison of RedGard, KERDI, and HYDRO BAN—how Tillerstead selects and installs each system to TCNA and NJ code for lasting, warrantable showers."
---

Even flawless tile work fails if the waterproofing beneath isn’t installed **precisely to manufacturer and code spec**. At **Tillerstead LLC**, every shower is built to **ANSI A118.10 (waterproof membranes)**, **A118.12 (crack isolation)**, and the **TCNA Handbook** (details B422, B421, B415, etc.), ensuring your system is **documented, warrantable, and durable**—not just attractive.

Below: a field-tested, code-referenced comparison of three leading systems available at local supply houses and big-box retailers.

## 🔴 RedGard® (Custom Building Products) — Liquid-Applied Membrane

**Type:** Roll/trowel-on liquid waterproofing, *ANSI A118.10* compliant

**Best for:** Cost-effective installs over cement board or mortar beds

**Advantages:**  
- ✅ Readily available  
- ✅ Adapts to complex shapes  
- ✅ Low material cost

**Critical Installation Steps:**  
- Apply **minimum two coats** at **30–35 mils wet-film thickness**; confirm with a wet-film gauge  
- Reinforce **all plane changes and penetrations** with alkali-resistant mesh per manufacturer’s instructions  
- Allow **full cure (typically >24 hrs)** before flood testing per **IAPMO PS 106** and local code

**Typical Failure Points:**  
- ⚠ Insufficient thickness or pinholes  
- ⚠ Missing mesh at seams/corners  
- ⚠ Premature flood testing before full cure

## 🟠 Schluter® KERDI — Sheet Membrane System

**Type:** Polyethylene sheet membrane, bonded with unmodified thin-set (*ANSI A118.1*)

**Best for:** Full rebuilds requiring testable seams and integrated drains/pans

**Advantages:**  
- ✅ Surface-applied waterproofing  
- ✅ Compatible with KERDI-Drain and prefabricated pans  
- ✅ Easy, code-compliant flood testing

**Critical Installation Steps:**  
- Embed sheets in **unmodified thin-set mortar (ANSI A118.1)** over a clean, flat substrate  
- Maintain **2″ (50 mm) overlaps**; roll seams to eliminate voids  
- Use **KERDI-Band, KERDI-Corners, and KERDI-Fix** at all transitions and penetrations

**Typical Failure Points:**  
- ⚠ Skipped seam overlap or poor embedment  
- ⚠ Use of modified thin-set (voids warranty)  
- ⚠ Unsealed fastener holes at benches/niches

## 🟢 LATICRETE® HYDRO BAN® — Premium Liquid-Applied Membrane

**Type:** Liquid membrane, *ANSI A118.10 & A118.12* compliant

**Best for:** High-performance, elastic waterproofing under tile in showers, steam rooms, and exteriors

**Advantages:**  
- ✅ Highly elastic, crack-isolating  
- ✅ No fabric required at most plane changes  
- ✅ GreenGuard-certified, low-VOC

**Critical Installation Steps:**  
- Apply at **0.02 in (0.5 mm) dry-film thickness**; verify coverage (≈50 sq ft/gal at two coats)  
- Reinforce large movement joints/gaps with **LATICRETE Waterproofing/Anti-Fracture Fabric**  
- Allow **2 hrs between coats** and **24 hrs cure** before flood test (per LATICRETE TDS 410)

**Typical Failure Points:**  
- ⚠ Under-applied thickness or missed corners  
- ⚠ Mixing with incompatible sealants/mortars

## ⚖️ Tillerstead’s Code-First, Warranty-Backed Approach

We **select the right system for each project**—never forcing a “one-size-fits-all” solution. All mortars, sealants, and tapes are paired by **manufacturer specification** for:

- Full warranty coverage  
- Predictable cure/bond performance  
- Compliance with **NJ IRC P2709** for shower receptors

Every phase is documented—**photos, flood-test logs, substrate flatness checks**—so your shower is **proven watertight and code-compliant**.
