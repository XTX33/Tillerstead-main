## Core Philosophy: "The 48 Laws Applied to Tile"

- **Empower Clients:** Frame expertise as enabling informed decisions.  
    _"You deserve to know why..."_  
    _"You're asking the right questions—here's what substrate deflection actually means..."_

- **Be Intriguing, Not Overwhelming:** Use technical terms with concise explanations.  
    _"TCNA standards (the 412-page handbook most contractors haven't opened)"_

- **Bold, Memorable Positioning:** Challenge assumptions with specific, provocative headlines.  
    _"The Tile Work That Outlasts the Mortgage"_

- **Signal Scarcity & Selectivity:**  
    _"Booked 4–8 weeks out"_  
    _"We turn down jobs that can't be done right"_

- **Promote Standards as Belief System:**  
    _"TCNA-compliant installations vs. 'some guy who watches YouTube'"_

- **Direct, Confident Claims:**  
    _"Cracked tile? It's deflection or wrong thinset. Always."_

- **Effortless Mastery:**  
    _"We check substrate flatness (1/8\" in 10' for rectified tile)—basic stuff"_

- **Target Pain Points:**  
    _"Texts returned same-day. Not 'left on read' for three weeks."_

- **Make Work Visible:**  
    _"Flood test photos you can show your skeptical spouse"_

- **Align Values:**  
    _"Built for long-term performance, not short-term profit"_

---

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

- **Technical, Accessible:** Use industry terms, explain as needed (see [/.ai/STYLE.md]).
- **Confident, Not Arrogant:**  
    _"We know our stuff"—never "We're better than you"._
- **Self-Aware Humor:**  
    _"We're the kind of annoying that measures substrate flatness"_
- **Direct, Honest:** Address uncomfortable truths with solutions.

### Contextual Tone

- **Homepage/Hero:** Bold, provocative, specific.  
    _"The Tile Work That Outlasts the Mortgage"_
- **Service Descriptions:** Detailed, standards-based, contrast shortcuts.  
    _"C2-rated thinset, not 'whatever's at the truck'"_
- **About/Process:** Personality-driven, transparent, addresses frustrations.  
    _"We're the kind of annoying that measures substrate flatness"_
- **Technical Content:** Authoritative, plain language, cite standards.  
    _"ANSI A108.10 waterproofing (because 'probably fine' isn't a plan)"_

---

## Positioning: The Anti-Corner-Cutter

**What We Are:**  
- TCNA/ANSI/OSHA compliant (cite standards, e.g., TCNA 2024, ANSI A108.10)  
- Documentation-obsessed (photo logs, written scopes, inspection checklists)  
- Communication-focused (same-day responses, realistic timelines)  
- Owner-operated (Tyler on every job, direct accountability)  
- Selective (turn down jobs that can't be done right)

**What We’re Not (Implied):**  
- The cheapest quote (quality saves long-term)  
- The fastest timeline (proper cure times, no rushing)  
- The "yes man" (no false promises)  
- The mystery crew (no unlicensed labor)

**Contrast Proper Methods vs. Shortcuts:**  
- _"We measure substrate flatness (most don't)"_  
- _"Ask your quote for their HIC number. We'll wait."_  
- _"C2-rated thinset with ISO 13007 certification (not 'whatever's on sale')"_  

---

## Language Patterns

- **Power Words:** Documented, tested, standards-compliant, licensed (with HIC #), verified, accountable, realistic, preventive.
- **Humor:** Self-deprecating pedantry, absurdist comparisons, exaggerated obviousness, sarcastic air quotes, parenthetical asides.
- **Technical Specificity:** Always pair terms with practical implications.  
    _"L/360 deflection limit (so your tile doesn't crack)"_  
    _"95% thinset coverage (TCNA 2024 update for large-format)"_
- **Contrast:**  
    _"Schluter KERDI membrane, not red paint from the box store"_  
    _"Texts returned same-day, not left on read"_

---

## Sentence Structure

- **Headlines:** Bold declarations or provocative questions.  
    _"Built to Last. Installed with Judgment."_
- **Body Copy:** Short, punchy sentences. Technical detail. Payoff or humor.  
    _"Your walls aren't plumb. Your floor isn't flat. That's normal—houses settle. We measure deflection (L/360 limit), check substrate flatness (1/8\" in 10'), and locate the moisture issues before they're surprises. Ignoring this is how you get the 'why is my tile cracking?' call."_
- **Bullets:** Specific claim + technical detail + implication.  
    _"**Waterproof showers that don't leak**: Schluter KERDI membranes installed to spec. Flood tested before tile. Seam details done correctly. Because 'probably fine' isn't a waterproofing strategy."_

## Content Types & Applications

- **Service Pages:**  
    Structure: Bold claim → Technical specifics → Contrast → Client benefit.  
    _See `/services/` for examples._
- **About/Process:**  
    Structure: Personality → Competence → Process → CTA.  
    _See `/about/`._
- **Blog Posts:**  
    Structure: Common question → Technical answer → Practical implication → DIY vs. pro.  
    _Homeowner-friendly, professional positioning._
- **Email Campaigns:**  
    Structure: Story/anecdote → Technical insight → Next step.  
    Conversational, technically competent.
- **Social Media:**  
    Progress photos, technical captions, before/after, "things we find" stories.  
    Casual, never unprofessional.

## Voice in Action: Examples

**Before (Generic):**  
"We provide quality tile installation services with attention to detail and customer satisfaction."

**After (Tillerstead):**  
"We install tile the annoying way: substrate flatness verified, thinset coverage at 95%, and flood testing before a single tile goes in. Slower than 'some guy.' More expensive than the Craigslist quote. But you only pay once."

**Before (Generic):**  
"Custom shower installations with waterproofing systems."

**After (Tillerstead):**  
"Waterproof showers that don't leak. Schluter KERDI membranes (not 'red paint from the box store'). Flood tested with photos you can show your skeptical spouse. Because 'probably fine' isn't a waterproofing strategy."

**Before (Generic):**  
"Tyler is an experienced contractor serving South Jersey."

**After (Tillerstead):**  
"Tyler's the kind of contractor who measures substrate flatness with a level *and* a straightedge. Who knows the difference between modified and non-modified thinset. Who's read all 412 pages of the TCNA Handbook. Yes, this makes us slower and more expensive. It also means your shower doesn't leak."
