Legacy hero-panel – retained for backward compatibility only.
All new pages must use `{% include unified-hero.html %}` per /.ai/OUTPUT_RULES.md.
This panel delegates to the unified hero, ensuring TCNA/NJ HIC compliance and consistent technical positioning.
For custom hero content, update front-matter fields as defined in /.ai/DOMAIN.md.
